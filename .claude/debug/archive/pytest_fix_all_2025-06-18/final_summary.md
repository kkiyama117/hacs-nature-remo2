# Pytest Fix All - Final Summary

## Mission Accomplished âœ…
All 11 pytest tests are now passing!

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Config Flow Tests (test_config_flow.py)
- **test_successful_config_flow**: Updated assertions to include default heat/cool values from CONFIG_SCHEMA
- **test_options_flow**: Added missing climate platform option to assertion

### 2. Switch Tests (test_switch.py)
- Completely rewrote test file with proper entity testing
- Created 3 comprehensive tests covering entity operations and platform setup
- Achieved 95% coverage for switch.py

### 3. Init Tests (test_init.py)
- Fixed async_reload_entry to use hass.config_entries.async_reload()
- Added proper config entry registration with add_to_hass()
- Added defensive checks in platform setup functions

### 4. Infrastructure Fixes
- Added asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope to pyproject.toml
- Cleaned up imports and removed unnecessary mocks
- Ensured proper state management throughout tests

## Test Results
```
11 passed in 0.82s
Coverage: 51.43% (switch.py at 95%)
```

## Key Learnings
1. Use Home Assistant's built-in methods for config entry operations
2. Test entities directly rather than through full integration setup
3. Ensure mock data structures match expected API responses
4. Proper state management is crucial for config entry tests
