# UV and PyProject.toml Setup Plan

(This is generated by `.claude/commands/orchestrator.md`. See them also when restart or continue doing this plan.)

## Task Overview
Set up `uv` package manager and configure `pyproject.toml` to properly handle the `custom_components/hacs_nature_remo` source root for a Home Assistant integration.

## Current State Analysis
- Project has basic `pyproject.toml` using Hatchling
- Missing `requirements_dev.txt` and `requirements_test.txt` files referenced in docs
- Non-standard Python project structure with `custom_components` at root
- Tests and CI/CD expect traditional pip setup

## Steps Planning

### Step 1: Dependency Discovery and Analysis (1 subtask)
- Analyze all Python files to identify required dependencies
- Check test files for test-specific dependencies
- Review CI/CD workflows for tool requirements
- Output: Complete list of all dependencies with categories

### Step 2: UV and PyProject Setup (3 parallel subtasks)
- Create comprehensive `pyproject.toml` with all dependencies
- Configure pytest to recognize `custom_components` as source root
- Create `requirements_*.txt` files for backward compatibility
- Output: Working uv setup with proper imports

### Step 3: Testing and Validation (2 parallel subtasks)
- Run pytest with new configuration to verify imports work
- Test uv commands for development workflow
- Output: Confirmation that tests pass and development tools work

### Step 4: Documentation and CI Updates (2 parallel subtasks)
- Update CLAUDE.md with new uv commands
- Update GitHub Actions to support both pip and uv
- Output: Complete migration with documentation

## Expected Outcomes
1. `pyproject.toml` with proper source root configuration
2. Working pytest that can import from `custom_components.hacs_nature_remo`
3. UV-based development workflow
4. Backward compatibility for existing CI/CD
