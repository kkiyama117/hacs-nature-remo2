# Pytest Error Analysis and Fix Planning

(This is generated by `.claude/commands/orchestrator.md`. See them also when restart or continue doing this plan.)

## Overview

This task involves running pytest to identify test failures, documenting them in a markdown file, and creating a comprehensive plan for fixing the errors without modifying Python files.

## Steps Planning

### Step 1: Initial Analysis (1 subtask)

- Read CLAUDE.md to understand project structure and testing setup
- Identify test command configuration and requirements

### Step 2: Test Execution and Error Collection (1 subtask)

- Run pytest with appropriate flags to capture all error details
- Collect comprehensive error output including stack traces

### Step 3: Documentation (2 parallel subtasks)

- Create a structured markdown file documenting all test errors
- Categorize errors by type and affected modules

### Step 4: Fix Planning (3 parallel subtasks)

- Analyze error patterns and root causes
- Identify affected files and functions
- Create detailed fix strategies for each error category

## Expected Outcomes

- Complete error documentation in `.claude/pytest_errors.md`
- Comprehensive fix plan with prioritized actions
- Clear understanding of test failure patterns
