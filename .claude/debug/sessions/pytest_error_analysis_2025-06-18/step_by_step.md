# Step-by-Step Execution Summary

## Step 1: Initial Analysis ✅
**Summary**: Successfully read CLAUDE.md and understood the project structure. This is a Home Assistant Custom Component for Nature Remo integration using DataUpdateCoordinator pattern with climate, sensor, and switch platforms.

## Step 2: Test Execution and Error Collection ✅
**Summary**: Ran pytest using UV and captured all output. Found 4 setup errors all related to AttributeError for missing `async_get_data` method, and 3 skipped async tests due to missing markers. Total 7 tests collected.

## Step 3: Documentation ✅
**Summary**: Created comprehensive error documentation in `.claude/pytest_errors.md` with detailed error messages, affected files, and initial analysis. Identified the core issue as API method mismatch between tests and implementation.

## Step 4: Fix Planning ✅
**Summary**: Investigated actual API structure and created detailed fix plan. Tests are using generic template with wrong constructor args, non-existent methods, and incorrect endpoints. Plan includes 4 phases: updating fixtures, fixing async configuration, updating test logic, and creating proper test data.
